          <h4 class="page-header" id="gossBoard">OWF GOSS Board</h4>
            <p>OWF started as a project at a single US Government agency, but developed into a collaborative project spanning multiple federal agencies. Overall project direction is managed by "The OWF Government Open Source Software Board"; i.e. what features should the core team work on next, what patches should get accepted, etc. Gov't agencies wishing to be represented on the board should check <a href="http://owfgoss.org">http://owfgoss.org</a> for more details. Membership on the board is currently limited to Government agencies that are using OWF and have demonstrated willingness to invest their own energy and resources into developing it as a shared resource of the community. At this time, the board is not considering membership for entities that are not US Government Agencies, but we would be willing to discuss proposals.</p>

          <h4 class="page-header" id="nonGovernment">Non-Government</h4>
            <p>Contributions to the baseline project from outside the US Federal Government should be submitted as a pull request to the core project on GitHub. Before patches will be accepted by the core project, contributors have a signed <a href="https://www.ozoneplatform.org/ContributorLicenseAgreement1-3OZONE.docx">Contributor License Agreement</a> on file with the core team. If you or your company wish your copyright in your contribution to be annotated in the project documentation (such as this README), then your pull request should include that annotation.</p>

          <h4 class="page-header" id="government">Government</h4>
            <p>Contributions from government agencies do not need to have a CLA on file, but do require verification that the government has unlimited rights to the contribution. An email to <a href="mailto:goss-support@owfgoss.org">goss-support@owfgoss.org</a> is sufficient, stating that the contribution was developed by an employee of the United States Government in the course of his or her duties. Alternatively, if the contribution was developed by a contractor, the email should provide the name of the Contractor, Contract number, and an assertion that the contract included the standard "Unlimited rights" clause specified by <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252227.htm#252.227-7014">DFARS 252.227.7014</a> "Rights in noncommercial computer software and noncommercial computer software documentation".</p>

            <p>Government agencies are encouraged to submit contributions as pull requests on GitHub.</p>

            <li>Please check to make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned. We also recommend checking for related issues on the tracker, as a team member may be working on the issue in a branch or fork</li>
            <li>Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first</li>
